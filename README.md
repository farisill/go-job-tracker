# job-radar-linkedin

Job Radar is a browser extension that helps you browse LinkedIn job postings more easily. It checks each job card for your chosen keywords and highlights the ones that are relevant to you. It’s a simple way to filter through listings and quickly notice roles that match your interests.

The extension is currently being designed and tested for Firefox.

The project is entirely written with Claude.
